# The-Shifting-Grounds-of-America
 
A project where I explore scrollama, d3 and javascript to visualize my data in ways I'm not used to. This project examines public opinion on Trump and Biden - this was before the Biden decided to resign from the race. The intent behind the project was to create a clear and colorful chart and map that could show how opinion on both candidates has changed in the last year and what it says about American politics. The project is weaker than I intended it to be, because I was short in time.

I used Illustrator, Excel, Flourish, ai2html, and Datawrapper.

I spent a lot of time testing different ways to visualize my data through scrollytelling - I'm happy with how I did.
